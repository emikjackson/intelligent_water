#IceBreaker:
- Brown M&M reigns champion! In Grant's words, was a "cracking good time."

###Sustainability Workshop:
- Sustainability is meeting the needs of the present without negatively impacting the needs of future generations, with respect to society, economy, and the planet. 
- 4 conditions for sustainability of a project
1. Make progress towards an environmental or social challenge
2. Has little potential for undesirable consequences to overshadow project
3. Is adopted and self-sustaining in the market
4. Successful economically and has longevity

###General Updates
- DEQ project meeting on Oct 9th - very positive!
   [checkout the minutes here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q3BEi_yyhScc64WPjzkjoujZAT9QoNQGdBSfqSFUvqU/edit)
- 1-2 page project description due next week
- Need a new team name! Add ideas into the groupme

###Technical Subteam:
- Introduce [timeline](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1StQ-5QX4FVJVAAX3aXFsEd3MSLnJQ-lklhTRbJ7anZI/edit#gid=0) for project
   10/12 to 10/19:  Develop scope of project
   10/20 to a few weeks after:  Select a concept
   HOMEWORK:  DO RESEARCH ON THE CURRENT METHODS USED FOR MEASURING PHOSPHORUS. ALSO DO RESEARCH ON COST ESTIMATIONS. 
- [Deliverables for 10/12](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14pLdX1LR3BujGbZoN2dYhCtsu0EoEAAE6PBu286ECVM/edit)
Each sub-team should become familiar with their design space by doing this. This will pay dividends for the rest of the design cycle.
What we shouldn’t do: think too much about how our design will look. We’ll start thinking details later on, this is just to get you familiar with what’s there
####Structures: technology overview of things around, in, on water.	Ex: different kinds of boats, buoys, docks
Focus on material selection, geometry, and other notable design features
####Sensors: technology overview of primarily phosphorus sensors, but other ones that could be related to water.		        Ex: phosphorus, sedimentation, water flow, water pressure
Focus on operating principles of sensor and limitations to current products
####Computation: technology overview of potential computing devices for this project as well as code in similar projects. Maybe arduino or raspberry pi would be a good start
Focus on challenges of  using these devices and programs over long periods of time or in inhospitable weather
####Power: technology overview of current power generation and battery systems Ex: li-ion batteries, solar, water turbines
Focus on limitations of these technologies near water and unusual strategies
####Communication: technology overview of current communication technologies and their drawbacks Ex: messenger pigeons, wi-fi
Focus on potential limitations due to weather or location
####Systems Integration: Overview of phosphorus’ importance in the environment, especially aquatically. Also report on any other important environmental factors that we should look at

###Education Subteam:
- Begin work on Chaguiton presentation [(see doc)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mFXybuagJ5QQYHudYbviXotXtz2CofvZK3OGLL7rs6E/edit)
- Set date for presentation for team
- Create project documentation site for DEQ project (this!!!)
###Finance
- Set date and location for first fundraiser (bake sale)
- **11/3 bakesale!! Bake on 11/2**
